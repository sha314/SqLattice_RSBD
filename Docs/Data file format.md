## Data file format
1. First line of the data file should contain a json formatted header which will contain usable information about the data.
2. After that there should be few lines of comments where the description of the data will remain, e.g, name of the columns, meaning of symbols etc.
3. data should be separated by commas since a ".csv" file is good for analyzing the data.
4. Each line that is not the data itself should start with a '#' symbol (symbol of comment). This includes the header too.
5. Data should be written as column format but in special cases it can be different.
